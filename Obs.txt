Searching for google.com:80 or 173.194.203.106:80  -> valid since 80: port number for http 
Even google.com:443 -> since google.com secures its site using https 

But google.com:25 (error) 

Website with only http (no secure encryption):

http://httpforever.com/ (or http://neverssl.com) is a deliberate "reliable insecure connection" 
Works with port number 80 but not 443
