google.com:80 -> 80: port number for http or 173.194.203.106:80 
Even google.com:443 -> since google.com secures its site using https 

But google.com:25 (error) 


Website with only http (no secure encryption)
http://httpforever.com/ (or http://neverssl.com) is a deliberate "reliable insecure connection" 
Works with port number 80 but not 443
